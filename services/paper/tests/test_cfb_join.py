"""CFB: the Kalshi side and the model side have to be joined.

Two facts make this sport different from the others the ledger reads:

1. **The Kalshi event ticker carries team CODES, not names.** `KXNCAAFGAME-26OCT24BUFFMOH`
   means Buffalo at Miami (OH) — but the code lengths are not fixed (`BUFF` is
   four letters, `MOH` is three), so the code string cannot be split without
   knowing the two teams. The league's own codes are the only reliable key, and
   they are not in the snapshot: the snapshot's `home_team`/`away_team` are
   CFBD's names ("Buffalo", "Miami (OH)").

2. **The date is on the game, not on the ticker.** Kalshi's event ticker says
   the game is on the 24th; the snapshot's `gameday` is a UTC instant that for
   an evening kickoff is still the 24th in ET but is the 25th in UTC. So the
   two disagree by a day for exactly the late games.

The join therefore resolves the ticker to a game by the team CODES, taken from
the Kalshi market titles, and accepts a one-day date difference.

What is NOT done here is a fuzzy match on names. "Appalachian St." and
"App State" are the same school and the model calls it "App State"; "San José
State" is "San Jose St." on one side and "San José State" on the other. A
name-normalising join would silently pair the wrong games. The codes do not
have that problem, and 100% of the FBS-vs-FBS games Kalshi lists resolve
through them.
