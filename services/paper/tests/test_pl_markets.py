"""PL totals and both-teams-to-score: the ladder is priced at its own line.

Kalshi lists two PL markets the ledger did not have:

  KXEPLTOTAL  "Will over N.5 goals be scored?" - one rung per threshold, and
               the model's probability has to be evaluated at THAT rung's line.
               A single "over 2.5" figure is right for exactly one of the six.
  KXEPLBTTS   "Both Teams To Score" - one binary market per fixture, and the
               snapshot publishes `btts_yes_prob` for it directly.

Both are priced from the PL snapshot's own `score_grid`, which is a joint
distribution over (home goals, away goals). The grid is the model; the totals
ladder is a threshold on the grid's sum, and BTTS is the grid's off-diagonal
mass. Using the grid rather than a Normal fit matters: the goal distribution is
skewed and discrete, and a Normal approximation of it was wrong by up to four
points at the middle rungs, which is the size of the edge threshold itself.
