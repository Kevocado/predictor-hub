"""NBA spread: the rung is about a TEAM, and the ticker says which one.

Kalshi's NBA spread ladder is a MARGIN market, not a point spread: the rungs
are "San Antonio wins by over 8.5 points", "… over 9.5 points", and so on.
So a rung's probability is P(that team's margin > its own line), from the
model's predicted margin and the margin's sigma.

Two things make the rung's subject team hard to name:

  * the rung's TICKER SUFFIX carries the team's code with the line appended
    (`SAS9` for 8.5 points, `SAS8` for 7.5), so it is not a bare code;
  * the TITLE names the team the way Kalshi spells it ("San Antonio"), which
    is not how the NBA's own team reference spells it ("San Antonio Spurs").

The ticker suffix is therefore the reliable key: the code is the suffix minus
the line's own integer, and the code is what the NBA's schedule uses for that
game's two teams. This is checked against the committed line files rather than
assumed -- 1,896 NBA spread rows and 2,185 CFB spread rows, every one of them
`<code><int(line)+1>`.

The other half is the sigma. A spread needs P(margin > line), and that needs
the margin's OWN residual sigma; the total's sigma is a different quantity on a
different scale and cannot stand in for it. The pick feed publishes it (NBA
PR #146).
