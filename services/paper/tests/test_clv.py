"""Closing-line value: how much better the logged price was than the close.

CLV is a LEADING indicator. It is knowable the moment the market's last
pre-kickoff price is known, before the game is played, which is what makes it
worth looking at: it says whether the entry was early, and an edge that only
shows up after the result is luck.

Three rules the spec states, and this file pins each:

  * the closing price is the LAST snapshot strictly before kickoff, on the
    SAME side as the row, and a snapshot at or after kickoff is ignored;
  * a row with no pre-kickoff snapshot after its own log has CLV = null, which
    is counted and never zero;
  * CLV is reported beside the result and is NEVER a gate: the 300-settled
    floor, the interval and the calibration condition are untouched by it, and
    no segment may be called "has an edge" because of it.
