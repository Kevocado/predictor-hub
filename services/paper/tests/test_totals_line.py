"""NFL totals: the model probability must be for the rung's own line.

The ladder has one rung per threshold ("over 41.5", "over 47.5", "over 60.5"...).
The first wiring gave every rung the snapshot's single book-line over_prob, which
priced "over 60.5" as if it were "over the book line" and logged 25-43 point fake
edges that lost money. The probability now comes from the model's predicted total
and sigma (Normal), evaluated at each rung's line.
