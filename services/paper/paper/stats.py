"""The arithmetic the report stands on: uncertainty, calibration, and closing line.

Four things live here, all pure functions over a list of settled ledger rows.

`max_drawdown` is a port of `max_drawdown` in `algo-trade-hub-prod`
(`tradehub/backtest/metrics.py:36`, read at commit 12432be) — peak-to-trough on
the cumulative curve, starting the peak at zero so a losing run from the start
registers. Copied rather than imported for the same reason the fee schedule was.

The bootstrap is a PAIRED bootstrap: one resample of row indices, applied to
every per-bet quantity at once, so the confidence interval on pnl keeps the
correlation between "how often we were right" and "what we paid". Resampling the
columns independently would let an interval be built out of combinations of bets
that never happened.

Closing-line value is the reason this report exists at all: it compares the price
we logged to the last price anybody could see before kickoff, so it is not
measuring luck. CLV is positive when we beat that closing price, which is the
part of an edge that is supposed to persist.
