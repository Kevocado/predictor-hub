"""The append-only paper ledger: `data/paper/ledger.jsonl`.

One JSON object per line. The file is only ever opened for append, and no record
that has been written is ever rewritten or removed. Everything else in this
package depends on that, so it is worth being explicit about why.

The temptation with a ledger is to update a row in place — mark it settled, fill
in the pnl, correct the price. Every one of those edits is a chance to improve a
row using information that did not exist when the bet was logged, which is
exactly the hindsight the paper ledger exists to rule out. So:

  * A candidate is written ONCE, at the first observation at which it qualifies.
    The `id` is a hash of what was bet, not of when it was seen, so running the
    logger twice over the same market produces the same id and the second run
    writes nothing. Idempotency is a consequence of the id, not a separate check.
  * Settlement is a NEW record that references the candidate's id. The candidate
    line keeps `status: "open"` forever, on disk, as the claim that was made at
    the time. Readers fold the settle record on top; the file never does.
  * A later price is a `price_update` record. It cannot change the price the
    candidate was logged at, which is what makes closing-line value a real
    measurement instead of a restatement.

Void and push are recorded the same way — as a settle record whose outcome is
"void" — so a voided market still leaves its candidate line untouched on disk.

PAPER ONLY. There is no order-placement or credential code in this package, and
none may be added: a paper ledger that could place a real order could not be
run honestly against real data.
