"""Read the site repos' public artefacts: Kalshi line snapshots and model snapshots.

Two inputs, both git-tracked and public in the sibling site repos, both read
rather than fetched:

  data/lines/*.jsonl.gz            Kalshi market ladders, one gzipped JSON object per
                                   rung per snapshot. Written twice a day by
                                   NFL_Predictor's `.github/workflows/collect-kalshi-lines.yml`
                                   and NBA_Predictor's equivalent, and committed to
                                   those repos. Each row already carries `snapshot_ts`
                                   (when the price was seen), the quotes, and — for
                                   markets that have since resolved — Kalshi's own
                                   `result`. Rows are therefore self-settling: nothing
                                   here has to join a box score to find out who won.

  data/public_snapshot.json        the site's published model output. NFL's carries
                                   per-game probabilities keyed by game_id; NBA's
                                   carries results and aggregate model metrics but NO
                                   per-game probability. That asymmetry is why
                                   `snapshot_games()` returns nothing for NBA.
                                   F1's carries per-DRIVER probabilities per race,
                                   because a Kalshi F1 contract is one driver's
                                   contract rather than a game's.

Nothing in this module writes, and nothing here reaches the network.

#: (`KXNCAAFGAME-26OCT24BUFFMOH`) and the codes are not a fixed width -- `BUFF`
#: is four letters and `MOH` is three -- so the ticker's team string cannot be
#: split without knowing the two teams. The snapshot carries CFBD's names, so
#: the codes have to be mapped to them somewhere.
#:
#: This is an explicit table rather than a fuzzy match on purpose. "App State"
#: and "Appalachian St." are one school, "San José State" is spelled two ways
#: across the two sources, and five codes (CSU, KSU, NCST, WSU, WEB) are shared
#: between an FBS school and an FCS one of the same initials. A normalising
#: match would silently pair the wrong games, and a wrong pairing is a wrong
#: probability on a real bet.
#:
#: The second element of each pair is the name KALSHI uses, which is not always
#: the name CFBD uses: Kalshi writes "Northern Colorado" where CFBD writes
#: "Northern Colo.", and "Ohio St." where CFBD writes "Ohio State". The
#: ledger matches Kalshi's own market titles, so it needs Kalshi's spelling.
#:
#: Every entry is a fact about Kalshi's own published market titles, not a
#: guess: each code was read off the `<Team> wins` title of the market that
#: carries it, and each Kalshi name was checked to be a real title for that
#: code. A team missing from the table simply does not join, and the ledger
#: says so rather than guessing.
