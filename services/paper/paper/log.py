"""Turn Kalshi line snapshots into candidate rows, or refuse to.

This is where the no-hindsight rules live, so it is worth stating all four in
one place before the code:

  1. `logged_at` is the Kalshi row's OWN `snapshot_ts`, never the wall clock at
     the moment the logger happens to run. A row observed on Tuesday and written
     on Saturday is a Tuesday row.
  2. A row is only eligible if `snapshot_ts` is strictly before kickoff, read
     from the row's `occurrence` field. Unreadable means ineligible.
  3. The price logged is the ask from THAT SAME row. No other snapshot's price is
     ever consulted for a candidate.
  4. The model probability must come from a snapshot whose `generated_at` is at
     or before the price's `snapshot_ts`, using the latest such snapshot. If that
     ordering cannot be established the row is logged as a shadow, never as a
     candidate — a probability computed after we saw the price is hindsight with
     extra steps.

Rules 1-3 stop a post-kickoff price entering. Rule 4 stops a post-price
probability entering. They are different leaks and need different guards.

F1 adds a fifth guard of its own, because its contracts are not games. A
Kalshi F1 contract is one DRIVER's contract, so the probability is that
driver's own probability for that race; and Kalshi's F1 occurrence runs
about six hours later than the session it names, so the cutoff is the
earlier of Kalshi's occurrence and the session time the snapshot knows.

PAPER ONLY. Nothing here places an order; the only price written is one that was
publicly observable at the time it is stamped with.
