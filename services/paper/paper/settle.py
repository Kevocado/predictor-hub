"""Settle open rows from Kalshi's own resolution, idempotently.

Settlement here is a lookup, not a computation. Every Kalshi rung we logged came
from a row that carries `status` and `result`, and Kalshi is the authority on how
its market resolved. So a ledger row settles by matching its `ticker` to the
finalized Kalshi row for the same ticker and reading off what happened. There is
no scoreboard join, no box-score fetch, and no independent opinion about who
won.

That inheritance is the reason the four awkward cases are handled explicitly
rather than left to the arithmetic:

  win        result == "yes"  -> payout 1, pnl = (1 - price - fee)
  loss       result == "no"   -> payout 0, pnl = -(price + fee)
  push/tie   a finalized market whose result is neither yes nor no. Kalshi
             resolves its own ties (a spread landing exactly on the number is
             settled by Kalshi's published rule, not by us), so a push does not
             arrive as a distinct value -- it arrives as a finalized market with a
             non-binary result. It is treated as a VOID: the contract expires
             worthless and pnl is zero. The stake is returned; no fee is charged,
             because no contract traded.
  voided /   likewise: cancelled, postponed-then-abandoned, or expired unsettled.
  postponed  A postponed game is NOT void. Its rung simply stays un-finalized, so
             the row stays open, which is the honest state: we do not yet know.
             Only a final Kalshi resolution ends it.

Idempotent: a row with a settle record is skipped, and settling twice writes
nothing. Settlement is also append-only — the original candidate line is never
touched (see `ledger`).
