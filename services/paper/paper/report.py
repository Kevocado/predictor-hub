"""The segment report: does any market actually have an edge after fees?

Prints one row per segment and writes the same numbers to `data/paper/report.json`.

The gate, exactly as the brief states it. A segment may be called "has an edge"
only when ALL of:

  * at least 300 settled paper bets in that segment,
  * a paired bootstrap confidence interval on mean pnl whose LOWER bound is above
    zero — not merely one that excludes zero, since a segment which lost all 300
    of its bets also excludes zero, and
  * a calibration gap that is not widening.

None of the three can be waived, and there is no override flag. The first run
will almost certainly print "no" for everything, and that is the expected and
correct result: the interesting claim is the one the data refuses to support,
and a report that says so is the product working.

CLOSING-LINE VALUE is reported next to pnl because pnl is noisy and CLV is not:
CLV asks whether we found the price before the market did, which is the part of
the edge that should persist. Positive pnl with negative CLV is luck.
