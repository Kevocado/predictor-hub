/** Shared v2 panelFacts adapter.
 *
 *  One function, two call sites.  Each call site passes an input tagged with
 *  `kind: "PL"` or `kind: "SP"`.  The function dispatches on that tag and
 *  returns a union output type.
 *
 *  PL input: `{ kind: "PL"; fixture: PLFixture }`
 *  SP input: `{ kind: "SP"; game: SPGame; prediction: SPPrediction | null }`
 *
 *  PL output: `{ tiles: MarketTile[]; segments: Segment[]; legend: Segment[] | undefined }`
 *  SP output: `{ tiles: MarketTile[]; segments: Segment[]; legend: undefined }`
 *
 *  The input shapes are minimal structural interfaces declared here, not
 *  imports: the two sites' `GameSummary` types differ in fields this adapter
 *  never reads, and a shared library must not depend on either site's source.
 *  A caller's richer object assigns structurally.
 *
 *  `news_date` is an optional field on the output, read from the service; when
 *  absent the footer element is omitted.  This task does not depend on Plan 1.
 *
 *  The SP branch is a faithful port of Sports' `src/lib/panelFacts.ts` (the
 *  spec's rollout rule: every assertion in the site's tests must hold here).
 *  In particular the spread tile keeps the home-frame convention the field
 *  arrives in — `spread_line` is the home team's expected margin and
 *  `predicted_margin` is home minus away, so both numbers take one sign flip
 *  and their disagreement survives in every sign combination — and the moneyline
 *  tile carries the leading side formatted by the family's `pct`, never a raw
 *  decimal. An earlier draft of this branch showed the unsigned line beside an
 *  absolute discrepancy instead; the site's sign-combination matrix pins the
 *  double-flip form, so the draft's form is the one that changed.
