/**
 * The record strip: the two numbers the facts carry, and the proportion as
 * geometry.
 *
 * Spec §5a-bis, and this is the component that rule exists for. `record` is
 * `hits: 41, settled: 68`; the facts contain no `60.3`. So the text reads
 * `41/68` and the bar's width carries the proportion. Writing "60.3%" here would
 * be a third number this product invented by arithmetic on two real ones — the
 * same class of error as a model inventing a figure, and the reason the rule is
 * written down rather than left to whoever renders it.
 *
 * The accessible name says "41 of 68" for the same reason. A screen reader
 * cannot see a bar's width, so the numbers have to be in words; those words are
 * the facts' own, not a percentage derived from them.
