/** FixtureExplainer — the panel, three states.
 *
 *  The default state is the flow: an instant, local description built from facts
 *  the site already has, with no request made. The AI summary is behind a
 *  button, so nothing is spent until a reader asks. When the button's request
 *  resolves, the summary swaps in over a flow that never unmounts — there is no
 *  frame in which the panel is empty. When the request fails, the flow is still
 *  on screen and the button offers a retry.
 *
 *  The flow is always mounted. It is the one state that is always true, and
 *  keeping it mounted is what "the flow does not flicker away" means: the
 *  summary appears above it, not instead of it after a gap.

 *  record strip or a player list beside its panel passes them here and the
 *  summary state keeps them; a site with nothing to draw passes nothing and
 *  the summary renders bare. Every field is optional for exactly that reason.
 *
 *  `segments` does double duty: it draws the bar, and it is what the answer's
 *  pick is joined against. The service words a pick in its own vocabulary
 *  ("Ravens win", the shape PL ships) while a site labels its segments in
 *  theirs ("Ravens"), so the pick is translated through `barPick` before it
 *  reaches the panel — exactly label matches pass through, a trailing " win"
 *  is dropped onto a matching segment, and anything unplaceable is returned
 *  unchanged so the bar fails closed (nothing accented) rather than accenting
 *  the nearest segment to a claim nobody made.
