  /* §13c's linkage is a LOOKUP, and this is the half of it that was missing: a

   *
   * The key used to be forwarded whatever it was, and `dim` then dimmed every
   * segment whose `market` was not the highlight — so a key that matched nothing
   * lit nothing and dimmed everything, which is the one outcome of a control that
   * is worse than either alternative. It is not a rare edge: `template.py` always
   * emits `record` (`:164`) and pads with `context` (`:178`/`:184`), and neither
   * is a market, so on a no-pick panel *every* row is unlinkable and every click
   * faded the whole panel with nothing lit. §2's rule is that a value on screen
   * comes from something real or is absent; the de-emphasis is a value, and it was
   * being derived from a reference that pointed at nothing.
   *
   * A key with no figure under it therefore clears the highlight instead of
   * setting one. That is not a row that does nothing: every row means "light the
   * figure this row is about, or clear the light if there is none to light", so
   * an unresolvable row turns a light off, which is a change the reader can see
   * and undo by pressing it again. The alternative — rendering such a row as
   * plain text, so it is not a control at all — was rejected: a reader cannot
   * tell which of their rows have figures, and the spec's §6 item 4 says a *why*

        {/* A rebuilt pick shows NO band (spec §13e), and the decision is this one
            line. The band is still computed by `band_for` and still in the
            response — withholding a value the panel cannot act on is a rendering
            decision, and keeping it computed keeps it available to whatever reads
            the row next. It is withheld rather than softened because the number it
            describes came from a model asked after the event began: it had seen
            the score, so the band measures confidence in a number produced with
            the answer already known, and the two lines below already tell the
            reader the pick was made then. "STRONG" beside that asks the reader to
            resolve a contradiction this panel created. Hiding it fails closed,
            which is the direction the footer already fails in.

            Note this survives the rule change and the band withholding does not:
            the track record counts the pick (spec
            2026-10-01-track-record-counts-every-pick), and a confidence word
            about a number produced with the answer already known is still a
            claim the panel cannot make honestly. The old *reason* for hiding it
            — that the reader was being told the pick was held out of the
            record — no longer holds, and the reason above is what replaced it.
