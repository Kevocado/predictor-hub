/**
 * The summary grouped into Edge, Risk and Price — the grouping a reader scans.
 *
 * `FactorList` already marks each row "for the pick" / "against it" / "context"
 * and refuses colour-only meaning. This adds the three labelled groups the AI
 * plan's design puts on one screen, and the `RankDuel` picture on the rows that
 * are about an offence-versus-defence matchup.
 *
 * ## The rule this component exists to enforce
 *
 * **A figure may only reach the page if the row's own words state it.** `RankDuel`
 * draws two ranks; the headline beside it has to say those same two ranks, written
 * as ranks. `assertStates` refuses the row otherwise — the same rule, and the same
 * decision, as `SignalRows.assertFigureIsStated`, for the same reason: a bar at
 * 94% under words that never said 94% is a number a reader cannot check.
 *
 * "Written as a rank" is the part that is easy to get wrong, so it is a regex
 * rather than a number scan: `#28` states rank 28, and `"28 points allowed"`
 * does not, even though both contain the digits. A row that happened to state the
 * two ranks as some other figure would otherwise pass by accident, and the two
 * kinds of row — a duel row and a scoring row — can share a panel.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not rank, cap or reorder. The sport code sorts duels by strength, the
 * service orders the factors, and a cap here would silently drop a row for a
 * reason this component cannot see — the argument `SignalRows` makes about
 * ranking-and-capping in its own header.
 *
 * An empty group is omitted rather than padded: "fewer rows beats a weak row"
 * is the design's rule, and a heading over nothing is a claim the panel cannot
 * support.
 *
 * **The grouped rows do not take `expandable`/`expanded`.** `FactorList` clamps
 * its sentence to one line on a narrow viewport because the sentence is long and
 * the panel is already tall; a duel row is a rank and a rank, and clamping it at
 * 390px would hide the very words `assertStates` just checked — so these rows
 * wrap, and the `context` group below still goes through `FactorList` with the
 * panel's own clamp. The `context` group therefore keeps the old behaviour and the
 * new rows do not, which is the honest split: a clamp is a decision about a long
 * sentence, and these are not long.
