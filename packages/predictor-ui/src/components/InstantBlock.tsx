/** The facts, rendered before anything is asked for.
 *
 *  Every figure here comes from the site's own bundle or its `extras`. There
 *  is no request, no state and no effect: press the button or do not, this
 *  block is already true. That is the whole point of it — a reader should not
 *  have to spend a request to learn the probability the site already had.
 *
 *  Order is fixed: timing, verdict, tiles, bar, record. The timing row comes
 *  first because it governs how every number below it should be read, and the
 *  record comes last because it is about past picks, not this fixture.
