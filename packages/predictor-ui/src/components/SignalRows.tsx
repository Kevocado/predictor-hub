/**
 * `Signal[]` as the facts block renders it: one compact row per finding, a
 * headline of at most 12 words, and a collapsed evidence line a keyboard can
 * open.
 *
 * Spec `2026-10-01-fixture-signals-design.md` §3 (the contract), §6 (the look).
 * The type below is §3 **verbatim in field and meaning**; everything after it is
 * this component's own account of what the fields may not be used to do.
 *
 * ## The one rule everything else serves
 *
 * **A figure may only reach the page if the same figure is in the row's own
 * words.** A signal is code-computed (spec §2: "Code computes the insight; the
 * AI only chooses and words it"), so the temptation is to let the visual carry a
 * number the headline does not mention — a bar 74% wide under words that never
 * said 74%. That is the "the model supplies words and ordering, never a number
 * the panel renders" rule from explainer-v2, one level up, and it is why
 * `headline` is **two** fields and not one:
 *
 *   - `headline.text` — the one line a reader reads, at most 12 words.
 *   - `headline.figures` — the numbers the visual draws.
 *
 * They are separate so the two can disagree, and the test file asserts they do
 * not by reading both back out of the rendered DOM rather than by trusting that
 * they came from one variable. Merging them into one formatted string was
 * considered and rejected: a component that *parsed* its own headline to find
 * the figure would make that assertion vacuous — the number on the chip and the
 * number in the sentence would be the same string by construction, so "they are
 * equal" would hold for every possible implementation, including a wrong one.
 *
 * ## What this component refuses, and why
 *
 * Three refusals, all of the same kind: a mistake a caller can make that would
 * otherwise reach the page as a *false statement* rather than as an error.
 *
 *  1. **A rate outside [0, 1]** (`SignalFigureError`). The "9600%" defect in
 *     this contract's clothes: `figures.rate` is a share, and a yardage figure
 *     read as one draws a bar that runs off its own track.
 *  2. **A figure the visual needs and the row does not carry**
 *     (`SignalFigureError`). A `reliability_bar` with no `figures.rate` would
 *     draw an empty track, and an empty track reads as 0%.
 *  3. **A visual this package cannot draw** (`UndrawableSignalVisualError`).
 *     Phase 1 draws `delta_chip` and `reliability_bar`. `absence_strip` (phase 2)
 *     and `projected_vs_actual` (phase 3) are refused rather than rendered
 *     without their marker, which is the one failure mode that both tests and
 *     screenshots miss.
 *
 * ## What this component drops rather than refuses
 *
 * **A rate whose `n` is under the floor.** Spec §4: "Renders only at n >= 30;
 * below that the row says nothing, never a rate from a handful of games." So
 * the whole row goes, not just the rate — a headline reading "has been right
 * 74% of the time" with the bar and the `n` taken away is a worse row than no
 * row. `n: null` on a rate-drawing row is dropped for the same reason and is
 * **not** a special case of the arithmetic: there is no count, so there is
 * nothing that could have cleared a floor.
 *
 * ## Rejected: ranking and capping here
 *
 * Spec §2 puts the fixed rule in the signals layer — "a fixed rule (not the
 * model) ranks them by `strength` and keeps the top 2-3" — and the plan puts it
 * on the endpoint (`GET /signals/{game_id}` returns the top 3 by `strength`).
 * `PicksList` sets the opposite precedent and caps three rows per category
 * inside the component, because that is where it draws the rank numbers and
 * where a caller had already broken the rule. Neither transfers here. A
 * `SignalRows` row draws no position, so a cap in this component would silently
 * drop a row the endpoint ranked into its top three for a reason this component
 * cannot see, and a second copy of the ranking rule is a second rule — the
 * argument `scripts/ui-package.mjs` is written on. Rows render in the order they
 * arrive, and a test pins that.

 *    considered and rejected: it rejects dates that are valid and accepts
 *    strings that are not, because it never parses.
 *  - `headline` is `{ text, figures }`. §3 writes `headline: {figures...}`, an
 *    open object; the two halves are split for the reason in the file header.
 *  - `figures` is `Record<string, number>` rather than a union of per-visual
 *    shapes, because §3 leaves the figure names open and a caller is allowed to
 *    carry more than its visual draws. `signalFigure` below is what reads them,

/**
 * Clip a headline to `max` words, and say whether it was.
 *
 * **The rule: count whitespace-delimited words, keep the first `max`, and mark
 * the row `data-clipped`.** A word is a whitespace-delimited token because that
 * is what fits on one line — "−4.5:" is one word to a reader and two to a
 * tokenizer that also splits on punctuation.
 *
 * **Why clipping and not refusing, when a wrong number is not acceptable.**
 * Because clipping removes *words* and never edits a *figure*. The figures this
 * component draws come from `headline.figures`, which clipping does not touch,
 * so a clipped row still shows exactly the numbers it claims and loses only
 * prose — and the sample size survives regardless, because `n` is on the evidence
 * line whether or not the headline is clipped. A refused row, by contrast, loses
 * its whole finding because an adapter miscounted a word, which is a worse
 * outcome than a shorter sentence and a `data-clipped="true"` in the DOM.
 *
 * **A drawn figure is PROTECTED, and this was a real defect until it was.**
 * The first version claimed a clip "cannot corrupt a figure" on the grounds that
 * the figures are not in the text this function rewrites. That was wrong, and
 * CodeRabbit review comment 4171773475 caught it: the headline *does* speak them
 * — that is the whole honesty rule above — and "was right 74% of the time" can
 * sit at word 14. Clipping to 12 then left a bar at 74% under a sentence that no
 * longer mentioned 74%: exactly the dishonesty the split `headline` exists to
 * make impossible, reintroduced by the cap.
 *
 * So the rule is now: **keep the first `max` ORDINARY words, plus every word
 * that states a protected figure, in document order.** The protected forms are
 * passed in by the caller from the figure it is about to draw — this function
 * does not format, because the two formatters (`fmt.signed` for a gap,
 * `fmt.pct` for a rate) differ and guessing here would protect the wrong string.
 *
 * **THREE forms are protected for a rate, because `fmt.pct` has boundaries.** At
 * `p <= 0.005` it prints `<1%` and at `p >= 0.995` it prints `>99%`, never `0%`
 * and `100%`. A headline is written in plain words, so it can say `0%`, `100%`,
 * `+1%` or `<1%` where the formatter says something else, and protecting only
 * `pct(figure)` would leave the boundary rate as the one thing the clip removes.
 * `pct(figure)`, the rounded percent and the floored percent are all protected,
 * and BOTH sides of the comparison are normalised — a leading `+`, `−`, `<`, `>`
 * and any trailing punctuation are dropped — so a `<1%` in the text matches a
 * protected `<1%` instead of stripping one side only (CodeRabbit review comments
 * 4171835614 and 4171902960).
 *
 * The match is on a WHOLE word, never a substring: protecting `1%` must not also
 * protect `61%`, which would keep a clause unrelated to the figure and could
 * still drop the one that carries it. `norm` is lossy in one direction only — it
 * removes a sign and a boundary symbol, and neither is part of the number — so it
 * cannot make two different figures compare equal.
 *
 * **What is given up.** A clipped row can exceed `max` words, so the cap is
 * "12 ordinary words" rather than "12 words", and a headline that names its
 * figure on every one of forty words stays forty words long. That is an adapter
 * copy bug rather than something this component can repair, and `data-clipped`
 * is the signal for it — the fix is the adapter's shorter wording.
 *
 * **What would make this a refusal instead: a NEGATION.** "Out: J. Jacobs is
 * **not** projected" clipped to "Out: J. Jacobs is" inverts the claim, and no
 * amount of figure-protection helps. None of the four spec §4 signals can produce
 * one from their own fields — `kind` says which claim a row is making — so it is
 * not reachable here. The note is here so the next person checks it before
 * adding a `kind` that can.

          * `n` and the date are ALWAYS visible and OUTSIDE the control, in the
          * panel's own small faint type rather than the button's uppercase
          * tracking. Two reasons, and the first is the whole one: `n` is the
          * sample size, so uppercasing it prints `N=61` and a reader takes that
          * for a name rather than a count — and a count is the one thing on this
          * row a sceptic needs without opening anything.
          *
          * **WHAT IS AMBIGUOUS IN THE SPEC, and the reading taken.** §6 asks for
          * "a collapsed evidence line (source, n, date)", and its parenthetical
          * names three fields while "collapsed" names a hidden state — so it
          * cannot mean all three are behind the control. This reads it as: the
          * line carries all three, and what collapses is the LONG one. `source`
          * is a free string from another repository ("stored pre-kickoff picks,
          * 0.5-0.6 bucket") and is the field that makes a row two or three lines
          * deep at 390px; `n` and a formatted date are short and cost one line.
          * So `n` and the date sit in the collapsed row and `source` is what the
          * button reveals. A reading where all three hide was rejected: it makes
          * the sample size unavailable without a pointer's worth of interaction
          * on the exact claim a reader most wants to check. */}
