/**
 * Kickoff-hour conditions as one small chip: a picture, then the words.
 *
 * The words are always there, so the picture never has to carry the meaning
 * alone and a screen reader gets the same sentence as everyone else. That is the
 * product's standing rule (PRODUCT.md, "no meaning carried by colour alone") and
 * it is why this is a `<span>` of text with an icon in front of it rather than an
 * icon with a tooltip.
 *
 * `conditions` is the object the sport API serves: `kind`, `temp_f`, `wind_mph`,
 * `precip_pct`. The WMO-code-to-kind mapping lives in the API, once; this
 * component draws a `kind` it knows and renders NOTHING for one it does not,
 * because a sky drawn as a guessed one is a false statement rather than a rough
 * edge. No conditions, no chip — the absence of a chip says nothing, which is the
 * honest state for a game two weeks out or a stadium we have no forecast for.
 *
 * The thresholds are what a football fan needs, not what the data carries: wind
 * under `WINDY_MPH` is noise on a field, and a 20% chance of rain is not worth
 * the words. Both are named constants so a reader can see the line rather than
 * find it in a comparison.
