/** The confidence word, as a word.
 *
 *  `band` arrives from the service already computed from `pick.prob` (spec
 *  §13a), and this component **renders what it is given and never recomputes
 *  one**. The thresholds live in one Python function; a second copy in
 *  TypeScript is a second thing to keep right, for no benefit, and the whole
 *  point of computing it server-side is that a model cannot call a 52% pick
 *  strong.
 *
 *  It is a chip rather than a coloured bar because a colour here would be a
 *  confidence nobody can check, and the words are what make it checkable. Uppercase
 *  and tracked out, matching the family’s status labels.
