/** SummaryButton — the only network caller in the panel.
 *
 *  One job: turn a press into a summary or an unavailable state, and nothing
 *  else. The request function is injected, so the button carries no fetch, no
 *  URL and no knowledge of the route — a test stubs the request and the network
 *  is never touched.
 *
 *  Three failure modes, one outcome. A rejecting request (a dead container, a
 *  proxy 502), a request that outruns the budget, and a 2xx whose body is not
 *  the expected shape all funnel to `onUnavailable`. The fixed upstream message
 *  is never shown to a reader: the button offers a retry and the flow is
 *  untouched.
 *
 *  A second press cannot double-fire: the button is disabled while a request is
 *  in flight, and the handler guards on the same flag.
