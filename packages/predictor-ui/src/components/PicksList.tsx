/**
 * The model's own top calls, ranked per category.
 *
 * Three rules are enforced HERE rather than left to every caller, because each
 * one has already been broken at least once by a caller that was being careful:
 *
 *  1. **A row's visual must match what its number IS.** `kind: "probability"`
 *     draws a share bar and `kind: "projection"` draws a key number with a ±.
 *     Passing a yardage figure as a probability once rendered "9600%", so the
 *     two kinds have disjoint ranges and a value outside its own is refused by
 *     name rather than drawn.
 *  2. **An out player leaves the ranking entirely.** A row marked `out` is
 *     refused. There is no greyed-out row and no "flagged in place" state to
 *     opt into — the caller passes them in `out`, where they are shown once,
 *     below the lists, with the source and the date.
 *  3. **Three rows per category, and three is a ceiling.** Fewer when fewer
 *     exist. Nothing is padded to fill the list.
 *
 * Provenance is the caller's own words, verbatim. This component composes no
 * confidence language at all: a probability, a bucket context and a ± are all
 * it renders, so there is no sentence here that could claim an edge, a price
 * or a guarantee — no odds feed exists in any of these repos.
 *
 * And a fourth rule, which is not a guard against a careless caller but a
 * decision about what a row says:
 *
 *  4. **A row's `detail` is drawn only on a probability row whose detail adds
 *     a word the category heading does not already carry** — `rowShowsDetail`.
 *     See it for the rule, the two readings of "always" that were rejected, and
 *     the real `Sports_Predictor` payload that defeated the first version of
 *     this rule.

/**
 * THE RULE. Does this row draw its `detail`, with a qualifier?
 *
 * Two conditions, and the first one is not optional.
 *
 * **1. `kind === "probability"`.** A call is a share — "this happens, at this
 * price of confidence" — and a projection is a magnitude: 284 yards, 10.2
 * rebounds. `kind` is the field this component already treats as the
 * authoritative statement of what a row's number IS, to the point of throwing
 * `RowKindMismatchError` at a row whose kind contradicts its value, so it is
 * the one thing here that cannot be a guess. A projection row's `detail` is a
 * label for the quantity, which the heading above it already names, and drawing
 * it twice is the defect rule 4 exists to end.
 *
 * **2. The detail adds a word the heading does not carry** —
 * `detailAddsToHeading`. Still load-bearing: `Sports_Predictor`'s two touchdown
 * categories are `kind: "probability"` with `detail` set to the heading's own
 * text, and without this half they print their heading three more times.
 *
 * **THE DEFECT THIS WAS FOUND WITH.** The first version of rule 4 was condition
 * 2 alone, and it passed the harness fixture — which used heading `"Rush yds —
 * projections, not probabilities"` with detail `"Rush yds"`, where the tokens DO
 * match. The real `Sports_Predictor` `origin/main` payload is
 * `{ category: "QB passing yards", detail: "Pass yds", kind: "projection" }`
 * (`src/lib/picksPanel.ts:79`, and the same shape at :80 and :81), so three of
 * that panel's categories drew an abbreviation of their own heading, AND drew
 * it with ` · model call` glued on, because the qualifier was applied to every
 * rendered detail regardless of kind. The fixture could not see either, because
 * no real row used an abbreviation. `src/components/sportsPayloads.test.tsx`
 * now holds the real rows and fails on both.
 *
 * **WHY NOT "tolerate abbreviations".** Considered and rejected, because every
 * version of it fails silently somewhere. A synonym table (`yds`→`yards`,
 * `rec`→`receiving`) is a sport's slang living in a component five sports share
 * — wrong for NBA and PL the day it meets them, and a new table for every
 * abbreviation any adapter invents. Prefix matching catches `pass`/`passing` and
 * `rec`/`receiving` but **not** `yds`/`yards`, so it would fix three of the
 * four words and leave the one that decides. And a digit heuristic ("a line has
 * a number in it") would suppress `3+ receptions`, which is information.
 * Condition 1 needs no table at all and is right about every one of them.
 *
 * **WHY NOT "callers pass a `detail` matching their own heading".** Correct, and
 * it is the cleanup worth doing — `positionCategories()` typing `detail` as the
 * category's own short label is the legacy meaning, and deleting it is the real
 * fix. Rejected as the fix here because it needs a `Sports_Predictor` PR, and
 * this package is vendored from `main`: between this merging and that landing,
 * three live categories would be wrong with nothing in the hub able to stop it.
 * Condition 1 is correct today, with no adapter change and no drift window.
 *
 * **WHAT IS GIVEN UP.** A probability row whose detail is built entirely from
 * words the heading already carries is dropped, so a caller cannot disambiguate
 * two rows in one list by such a word — `detail: "passing"` under `"QB passing
 * TDs"` draws nothing. Accepted: the heading is what the reader navigates by,
 * and `value` already separates two rows under one heading. And a projection row
 * can carry NO qualifier at all, even one its caller supplies, because the
 * qualifier is a claim that the row states a call.
