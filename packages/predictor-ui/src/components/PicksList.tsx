/**
 * The model's own top calls, ranked per category.
 *
 * Three rules are enforced HERE rather than left to every caller, because each
 * one has already been broken at least once by a caller that was being careful:
 *
 *  1. **A row's visual must match what its number IS.** `kind: "probability"`
 *     draws a share bar and `kind: "projection"` draws a key number with a ±.
 *     Passing a yardage figure as a probability once rendered "9600%", so the
 *     two kinds have disjoint ranges and a value outside its own is refused by
 *     name rather than drawn.
 *  2. **An out player leaves the ranking entirely.** A row marked `out` is
 *     refused. There is no greyed-out row and no "flagged in place" state to
 *     opt into — the caller passes them in `out`, where they are shown once,
 *     below the lists, with the source and the date.
 *  3. **Three rows per category, and three is a ceiling.** Fewer when fewer
 *     exist. Nothing is padded to fill the list.
 *
 * Provenance is the caller's own words, verbatim. This component composes no
 * confidence language at all: a probability, a bucket context and a ± are all
 * it renders, so there is no sentence here that could claim an edge, a price
 * or a guarantee — no odds feed exists in any of these repos.
