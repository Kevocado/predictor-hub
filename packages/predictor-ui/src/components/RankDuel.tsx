/**
 * One offence-versus-defence duel as two bars.
 *
 * A bar is how good a unit ranks: full is first of the league, a stub is last.
 * The rank is **always printed beside its bar**, so the bar is a picture of the
 * words rather than the only thing carrying them — the same rule `SignalRows`
 * enforces on its rows, and the reason this component draws ranks rather than
 * percentages: "#3 of 32" is a claim a reader can check against the league table,
 * and a bar is a picture of that claim.
 *
 * Nothing here computes a duel. `Duel` lives in each sport repo and its rows
 * arrive in `context.matchups`; this draws the two ranks it is handed.

 * of 40 in a league of 32 is a bad fact, and the failure belongs in the adapter
 * that produced it, which has tests.
