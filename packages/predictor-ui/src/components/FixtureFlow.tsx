/** FixtureFlow — instant, local, state-appropriate description.
 *
 *  Pure function of its props.  No useEffect, no fetch, no timer.
 *  Renders the game flow for the given sport and state.
 *
 *  **The pre-game prose is gone, and the instant block is why.** The block
 *  (`InstantBlock`) draws the timing, the verdict, the tiles, the bar and the
 *  record from the very same bundle; saying them here as sentences is what put
 *  one figure on a page in two places with two values. What is left here is the
 *  fixture's own name — a name, not a claim — and then only the sentences that
 *  carry news: the score and how it stands while the fixture is live, and the
 *  result and the pick's rightness once it is finished. A state with nothing to
 *  say renders an empty flow, which is the honest reading: the facts are above.
 *
 *  Honour assertions (must bite):
 *  - No line named that is not there (test on rendered strings, not keys).
 *  - No direction marker, no "the market disagrees", no derived percentage.
 *  - F1 draws no market-line tile and no split-bar market row.
 *  - Every sentence is true for every bundle that reaches it.
